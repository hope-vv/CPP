Understand the problem

Input: A single string with an RPN expression (e.g., "8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 +").
Output: The final result after evaluating the expression.
Operations supported: + - * /.
Constraints:
    Numbers are integers < 10.
    Errors must print "Error" to std::cerr.
RPN works like this:
    Read tokens from left to right.
    If token is a number → push it onto a stack.
    If token is an operator → pop two numbers, apply the operation, push result.
    At the end → only one number should remain on the stack → this is the result.
